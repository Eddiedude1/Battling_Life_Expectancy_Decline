# Battling_Life_Expectancy_Decline
Deloitte hackathon. 

In December 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the life expectancy of those living in the United States had decreased for the second year in a row. Currently, Americans are expected to live for 78.6 years. (It is important to note the stunning difference between sexes; American women live an average of 81.1 years whereas American men live an average of 76.1 years.)

Under the Stafford Act, the President may declare a national emergency and make available funding (through FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency) to address the emergency. Your team will be responsible for designing a federal program to reverse this trend.

Suppose that the President used the Stafford Act to make available one billion dollars in 2018 to address this problem. Considering the various avenues - implementation, research, education, etc. - how would you allocate this money?
Estimate the impact of this money by forecasting its effect on life expectancy and any other metrics you deem relevant.
As your team seeks to tackle this complex problem, there are a few things you might consider:

Research states or localities that have higher life expectancy. From this, try to identify factors that might affect life expectancy.
When allocating money, are there existing organizations or entities set up that might make for more cost-effective implementation of your program?
Estimate the cost, effect, and timeline of the federal program you seek to implement.
Presentation
A seven-minute presentation (you will be cut off!) showcasing your answers to parts 1. and 2. above to a non-technical audience. At the end, you may be asked questions.

You will be evaluated by a panel of judges on a score of 1 to 5 on each of the four following criteria:

Data-Driven Solutions (Did the team present solutions backed by evidence and data? Are assumptions and decisions rooted in research?)
Implementation & Feasibility (Did the team create a workable program? Did the team appropriately address logistics such as cost, timeline, and implementation?)
Methods (Did the team apply appropriate methods? Did the team communicate findings appropriately?)
Visualization (Are findings presented in a visually appealing manner? Are the data visualizations clean? Do they clearly communicate the intended point?)
The judging will occur based on your presentation. We will not have an opportunity to review code, etc. before declaring a winner.

Hackathon Best Practices
Get everyone on the same page. Decide how decisions will be made. Use different people for their strengths.
Set up deadlines. Add a buffer. Stick to the deadlines as best as you can. For example, make the project "due" at 3:00. Then, when does modeling need to conclude? When does EDA need to conclude? Is the timeline "linear" or can things happen simultaneously?
Develop a strategy quickly. It is to your benefit to have a strategy decided in the first hour than to "EDA" toward a strategy for a couple of hours.
If the existing data is insufficient, gather more. However, don't spend all day gathering data or conducting EDA.
Answer the prompt! A simple complete answer beats a complex incomplete answer.
